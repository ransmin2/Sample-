An athletics club require a simple statistical analysis program for analysing lap speed for runners.

2. Process the results by 
 Allowing a user to enter a race participants name
  Allowing a user to enter a race participants completion time (a value between 0.00 & 10.00 mins.) 
3. When data entry is complete, display a menu with the following options
  Display average race completion time 
 Display the fastest race completion time
  Display slowest race completion time
  Sort & Display the race times in descending order 
 Search for an individual race participant by name
 4. For each of the above functions, you are required to implement an appropriate method
